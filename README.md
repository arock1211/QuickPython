# QuickPython: Quick &amp; Painless Introduction to Python
### For adding Python to the data analysis toolbox as fast as possible!

#### Austin Rock, Data Engineer, IQVIA 2022 

This repository is geared towards those who know little, if anything of Python, or even programming as a whole. You may have heard about Python or are simply interested in utilizing its utilities to make your job easier. Whatever the reason, this tutorial will serve as a *quick* introduction to the language. 

* __Quick and Painless__: You will be spendling less time learning about things you don't need for your immediate job, and more time focusing on the core concepts that you will use right away.

* __For programing novices__: This tutorial was geared towards those who are comfortable in Excel or SQL, but have not mastered any object oriented programing languages.

* __Foundational__: I'm hoping to teach you the basic building blocks of the language and hopefully pique the your curiocity to learn more and dig deeper. If you understand the foundation and can *converse* in the lingo, you will be able to use the most foundational coding practice of all: __Stack Overflow__ to quickly expand your toolbox to whatever you need.

#### INTERMEDIATE PYTHON CONCEPTS

## Lesson 1: Getting Started with Python

The necessary (and truly only) starting point to your journey learning Python is to download the language! This requires you to download both the language package itself, as well as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that allows you to create Python programs and run them.

* __First__ navigate to [this link](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download the applicable release of Microsoft Visual Studio Code. This is a lite IDE that includes many helpful things like a spellcheck, syntax suggestions, and other extentions developed by other folks that can make it easier to write and understand code. It will also allow us to create & run our Python programs. Follow the prompts to download the software and open it up once finished.

* __Once you have VS Code open__, the initial screen will look like this. Feel free to customize the theme to VS code and, if you'd like, create an account on the second bulletpoint to enable settings sync across different computers. Once you have finished setting up the IDE as you'd like, click "Mark All as Done" & press CTRL+SHIFT+X to open the Extentions tab. This will show all of the included language packages. To begin, search for Python using the top bar. Click on the first extention you see, authored by Microsoft, and Install.

* __Once Python installs__, you will see a Python specific welcome page. First, click on the prompt *Select a Python Interpreter*. This will select a version of Python that is installed on your machine & inform VS Code on how to compile the code. We will need to download Python in order to provide an interpreter. Follow [this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to dowload Python. __IMPORTANT__ it is critical that when you open the Python installer that you select *Add Python to PATH* before installing. Once you have followed the other prompts and Python has been installed, close the installer and restart VS Code. Once you have restarted the IDE, you should see that VS Code has automatically selected your installed version of Python as the interpreter. If this is not the case, click *Select Python Interpreter* and click on your preferred Python version to use. Regardless, you have finished downloading Python and setting up your IDE for programming! The next lesson will focus on our first program, and the basics of Python syntax.
