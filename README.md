# QuickPython: Quick &amp; Painless Introduction to Python
### For adding Python to the data analysis toolbox as fast as possible!

#### Austin Rock, Data Engineer, IQVIA 2022 

This repository is geared towards those who know little, if anything of Python, or even programming as a whole. You may have heard about Python or are simply interested in utilizing its utilities to make your job easier. Whatever the reason, this tutorial will serve as a *quick* introduction to the language. 

* __Quick and Painless__: You will be spendling less time learning about things you don't need for your immediate job, and more time focusing on the core concepts that you will use right away.

* __For programing novices__: This tutorial was geared towards those who are comfortable in Excel or SQL, but have not mastered any object oriented programing languages.

* __Foundational__: I'm hoping to teach you the basic building blocks of the language and hopefully pique the your curiocity to learn more and dig deeper. If you understand the foundation and can *converse* in the lingo, you will be able to use the most foundational coding practice of all: __Stack Overflow__ to quickly expand your toolbox to whatever you need.

## Lesson 1: Getting Started with Python

The necessary (and truly only) starting point to your journey learning Python is to download the language! This step is actually a bit trickier than is looks depending on the computer you are looking to work on. For the IQVIA computer, there is no restriction on what you can or cannot download. However, for Sanofi you will need to request any software via the Sanofi AppStore. I'd imagine most of you will be using the Sanofi laptop for any data operations, so I'll focus on the applicable steps. If anybody is planning on following this tutorial on your IQVIA or personal computers please send me an email and I will guide you through the download process! 

* __First__ navigate to the Sanofi AppStore and use the search box to find Microsoft VS Code. This is an IDE - Integrated Development Environment - for creating programs in Python, but more on that later. In the request box, put "Needed for IQVIA Integration" and wait for the email confirmation. Do the same for Python, search and request a download. Once both are downloaded, open it up!

* __Second__ once you have VS Code open, press CTRL+SHIFT+X to open the Extentions tab. This will show all of your installed language packages. To begin, search for Python using the top bar. Click on the first extention you see, authored by Microsoft, and Install. Once Python installs, you will need to restart VS Code to complete the installation. 

* __Third__ you will need to verify that Sanofi has installed Python on your machine. To do this, open the command prompt by navigating to the top bar of VS Code, hovering over the *Terminal* tab, and clicking *New Terminal*. Once this is done, you will see a command prompt terminal open at the bottom of the screen. Simply write the following query in the terminal: ```py -0``` This will show all versions of Python installed on your machine. 

* __Finally__ VS Code will prompt you at the top of the screen to select one as an interpreter to use for programming. Make sure to use the latest release. If you do not see this, you will get the pop up once we create our first Python program! Regardless, you have finished downloading Python and setting up your IDE for programming! The next lesson will focus on our first program, and the basics of Python syntax.
